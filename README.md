# Reinforcement Learning and Generative Models Project

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models through multiple implementations and experiments. The main components include:

- **LunarLander Environment**: Implementing a genetic evolutionary algorithm based on rewards.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Applying a DQN agent to improve performance in the LunarLander environment.
- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Implementing a U-Net architecture for image colorization.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

### ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning

- **Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm**: The LunarLander agent is trained using an evolutionary approach where individuals are evaluated by a reward-based fitness function.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: A DQN model is trained to optimize the agentâ€™s actions, maximizing the cumulative reward.

### ðŸŽ¨ Generative Models

- **GAN with U-Net**: A Generative Adversarial Network incorporating a U-Net architecture is used to colorize grayscale images.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **LunarLander with Genetic Algorithm**: The agent evolves over generations, showing improvements in landing stability.
